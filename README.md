## What is Rollup?

Rollup is authorization infrastructure for your apps so you can build great relationships with your users. For more information please checkout our [website](https://rollup.id) and [docs](https://docs.rollup.id).

## Rollup Monorepo Tour

Let's take a look around at the Rollup Monorepo layout...

## Platform

The [platform/](platform) directory is where all the core identity services are located. The Rollup platform is organized by "local-first" (or logically local) nodes (accounts, address, account, and more) organized in a graph by the Galaxy service.

## Apps

The [apps/](apps) directory is where the presentation layer applications (or backend for frontends) live. These apps include the Profile user experience as well as the Developer Console app.

## Packages

The [packages/](packages/) directory contains our libraries and other share components.

### Docs

The [docs/](docs/) directory contains the developer documentation portal.

## Develop

### Configuration

Please use the following tools and versions when developing with this repository:

- Node.js v17+

#### NIX ENV

Install NIX and run `nix-build` to install nix packages and `nix-shell` to execute a shell with a fully configured development environment.

Note that docker doesn't fully work using nix packages.

#### Developing

This monorepo is managed by Yarn workspaces and nested workspaces. You can run `yarn` commands (i.e., `yarn dev`) to run all the platform services and dependencies together. Applications require more resources so it is recommended to run them individually.
